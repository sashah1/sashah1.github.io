                                                develops and delivers design recommendations to researchers working on some of society’s most pressing challenges.<br><br>In this project my team created a “now, near, far” roadmap aimed to facilitate collaboration
                                                and align stakeholder interests in the Drinking Water Industry, with a goal of improving the health and safety of Michigan residents over the next 10 years. To do this we &nbsp;applied design research methods
                                                to conduct 70+ interviews, synthesize 2000+ data points, and ideate on our key insights. From the insights we created 4 tools that build empathy and increase collaboration between stakeholders. We validated
                                                our tools through usability testing with key stakeholders, and created a business model for smooth integration with private sector stakeholders.<br></p>

In my work, I supported and co created prototypes for different types&nbsp;of mating components for a detachable electronic housing for the Moxxly</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Flow and iterated on the features. In preparation for product launch, I designed,&nbsp;iterated and automated testing stations using Arduinos and 3D-printed modular&nbsp;test fixtures and constructed test plans and protocols for manufacturers in</strong><br><strong>China.

                                                that Skullcandy should not pursue a high end, true wireless earbud as it doesn’t fit with their target audience.<br><br><strong>Team: </strong>Market Researcher on a team of 5&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Research Methods: &nbsp;</strong>Survey

                                                among the four categories: Connection type (wireless or true wireless), Earfit (earbud), Health Features Via App (yes), and Price ($99.99, or 199.99). Then the partworths for each of the variables were found
                                                and those were used to determine people's willingness to pay for each feature.<br><br><strong><em>Crosstabs</em></strong><br>The crosstabs and T-test allow Skullcandy to determine which combination of variables
                                                show significance allowing them to target specific groups for specific products. We performed these tests on 14 combinations of variables from our survey. These combinations based off the following variables:
                                                Income, brand, ownership time, gender, time listened to per day, age, connection style, and earfit. To run the tests we used a One-way Anova or Chi-Square for each of the combination depending on whether
                                                they were a continuous or discrete variable.<br><br><strong><em>Factor Analysis</em></strong><br>Factor analysis was performed on two sets of independent variables: first, psychographics and lifestyle, then
                                                importance of various features. The factors were then used to in a regression of willingness to pay from the conjoint analysis.<br><br><strong><em>Cluster Analysis</em></strong><br>A cluster analysis was
                                                performed on the four categories from our conjoint survey. This was performed twice, first creating three clusters then with four clusters. The cluster analysis utilized the K-Means technique to iterate
                                                and find clusters.<br><br></p>

                                            <p style="text-align: left;">We flatly recommend that Skullcandy does not pursue a true wireless headphone at this time. As a company, Skullcandy has positioned itself as a budget-friendly, affordable brand, marketed towards the often low-income
                                                outdoor action sports enthusiasts. These customers are not likely willing to spend more for a set of true wireless headphones.<br><br></p>

                                            <p style="text-align: left;">Our primary limitation was a lack of demographic diversity. Most of the respondents to oursurvey were Marketing 618 students. As a result, nearly every respondent had the same education level, approximate age,
                                                and income. Our team at times had trouble in finding significant results in our survey data - especially when looking at demographic data - and lack of diversity may have been a contributing factor.<br><br>Many
                                                headphone purchasers make their decisions based on packaging, fit, and overall aesthetics. These traits are mostly visual and are difficult to describe in a survey without letting the potential customer
                                                see them in person. While we were able to gather information about other desired qualities in headphones, design is a vital aspect that was difficult to glean from a written survey. We therefore would advise
                                                Skullcandy to supplement this survey with focus groups among its target customers in order to better understand their desired feel and look of headphones.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                                water utilities and other water professionals are working together to tackle these water quality challenges. Their role is to produce clean water, distribute it to consumers so they can use it safely for
                                                drinking and bathing, and communicate water quality information to the public at large. Although the utilities are working to perform their roles, there is a gap in communication between the utilities, academic
                                                professionals, and other resources. The use of these resources and academic professionals could greatly help water utilities make better and more informed decisions regarding Michigan’s water crises.<br></p>

                                                <p>Initial primary research was done in the first two weeks of our discover stage consisting of a client meeting with Lut Raskin and attending two conferences. One conferences brought researchers from across
                                                    Michigan, community members, practitioners, decision-makers, and investors from the region to explore new innovations addressing water issues. The other conference brought together drinking water utilities
                                                    and university researchers to spark discussion on future collaboration. We then met with our faculty-client, where she discussed her current pain points, and solutions she had already explored. This
                                                    information was used to create a landscape map, which was used to find a cohesive and consistent view of the main organisations, stakeholders, and pain points in the industry.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                                <p>From the 70 interviews, over 2000 data points were collected and analyzed, marking the peak of our divergence between our discovery and define stage. At this point we started converging on the knowledge

                                                    were written for each key insights marking the end of our discover and define stage, and starting the ideate stage.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">We used brainwriting techniques to diverge on the HMW statements and over the course of a few days generated 8 design principles which list as follows:<br></p>
                                <p class="bullet">1. Understand shared goals and motivations for partnership</p>
                                <p class="bullet">2.&nbsp;Set up expectations and shared knowledge &amp; language</p>
                                <p class="bullet">3.&nbsp;Develop shared metrics for what constitutes success</p>
                                <p class="bullet">4.&nbsp;Understand the needs of a project before committing</p>
                                <p class="bullet">5.&nbsp;Strategically leverage the strengths of existing structures, gatherings, &amp; organizations to work toward a common agenda</p>

                                <p class="bullet">7. Bring in a diverse voices of expertise early on &amp; throughout the work</p>
                                <p class="bullet">8.&nbsp;Dedicate time and people to build knowledge and relationships&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 8px;">We used a combination of these design principles and the collective impact framework to create our final deliverables.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p>The team created a deliverable packet with 5 tools including a final insights and explanations section, a wicked problem map, an interactive stakeholder map, a key priorities tool, an opportunity map, and a recommendations
                                    list. The deliverable packet was shared with our client, the Blue Sky Initiative, stakeholders we met at the conferences, and all of our interviewees. The information is shareable and each tool is built in a way that
                                    can be iterated in the future.<br></p>

Researchers can use the tool
                                                to gain an understanding of the steps utility professionals will take and vice versa. Other stakeholders can see how they may contribute to the efforts by examining leverage points that express collaborative
                                                needs. The homescreen of the tool is shown below, where each dot represents an important step in the process. Users can click on the dot to see which design principle they should be using, a recommendation
                                                for how to move forward with collaborative research, and an example showing successful partnerships.<br></p>

                                            within public and charter schools across the United States. The database allows users to find and understand data at the national, state, district and school levels, and compare that data with other states,
                                            districts and schools nearby that differ in poverty rate and percentage of non-white students. The goal of the Miseducation project is to make racial disparity data in educational institutions easier to access
                                            such that those with the ability to create or incite change can use this as a resource to do so.<br></p>

                                                personalized outlets such as word of mouth, text, and direct message.<br></p>
                                            <p class="paragraph">We also found in our usability test that when users went to share this data the majority of them searched for share buttons, and when they weren’t able to find them, resorted to screenshotting or linking to

                                <p class="paragraph">While we feel strongly about the findings and recommendations we have identified, there are a few weaknesses in our data collection. Our interviews were conducted with users who didn’t end up in our final user groups (18-30-year-olds)
                                    for which we conducted the vast majority of our research. As such, we weren’t able to create personas or scenarios for this audience. While we were able to get a lot done in a small amount of time, we had small sample
                                    sizes. Also, we were only able to conduct the card sort and usability tests with Michigan residents, which is not a representative sample of who would use the tool. Finally, for our survey, given that we got most of
                                    our respondents through ProPublica’s twitter feeds, the survey respondents are likely strongly biased to using social media for news.<br></p>

                                <p class="paragraph">Given all of this information, We have three suggested next steps for further research<br></p>
                                <p class="bullet">•&nbsp;ProPublica could consider conducting focus groups with 18-35 year olds to further understand if the use of the miseducation tool would incite action among that population&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="bullet">• ProPublica could also replicate the card sorts and usability tests with a larger, more representative sample of participants</p>
                                <p class="bullet">•&nbsp;Finally, ProPublica could utilize our findings as a guideline for features to include or change for future news applications.</p>
